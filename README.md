# 🧠 QuickDesk AI Support

A smart, AI-powered Helpdesk solution built for the Odoo x CGC Hackathon 2025.  
QuickDesk enhances traditional support ticket systems with intelligent features like auto-reply suggestions, AI-based categorisation, and summarisation to streamline resolution workflows.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Design a lightweight helpdesk system with roles for end users, support agents, and admins. Users can create support tickets and track their status. Agents manage, respond to, and resolve tickets. Admins manage ticket flow and categories.

**Our twist:** We are enhancing QuickDesk using AI to reduce response time, improve clarity, and boost productivity.
